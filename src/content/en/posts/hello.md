## ProgOwer ?

Hello, I'm **ProgOwer**, a kind of combination between **Program** and **Power**, yes it's just a nickname to post my work online. I like technologies in general, and I learn by creating various projects in different domains.

## Langue ?

I speak in **French** and in **English** (also in Spanish, but not very well). Computing Science in general choose English as main language for some reasons, so all my **projects are in English**, but this blog which references my **projects, which will be available in English AND in French**.

## Projets ?

To learn, I chose to do everything in **project mode**, this allows me to :

- **Structuring** everything I build.
- **Building** something cleanly.
- **Realize** alone or with **several persons**.
- **To share** my works and **improve** them.

For these reasons and others, I do almost everything in project mode. My projects will set into three main domains :

- **Programming** : Application projects using various **programming languages** as well as **framework** (web, CLI, ...).
- **Infrastructure** : Projects to set up **machine / server**, **operating systems** or **Cloud** (local or with a provider).
- **Electronics** : Projects that mix **programming** and **electronics** (connected house, robotics, ...).

## Blog ?

Be **free** to use everything in this **blog**, the objective is to **share** with you my **work**, my **projects**, my **experiences** for it to be **useful**, **BUT** I can't be held responsible for the use you make of it, you remain in control of your **decisions** ! :warning:

See you soon, on another **post** :wink:.
